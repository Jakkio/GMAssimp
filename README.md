DLL Assimp version: 6.0.2

I don't know how to use cmake or cleanup the visual studio project, so in "dll" folder you just find the source code of the bridge dll between GM and assimp.
If you want to compile it yourself: good luck. It should be nothing crazy, just configure the linker. If you want to help me with that, it is very appreciated.
